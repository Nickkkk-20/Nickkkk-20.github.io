## <font color=blue> Study on the characteristics of microplastics (MPs) pollution in offshore sediments and its effects on microbial communities </font> 
Advisor: Donghui Wen (Professor, Peking University)  
Time: Jun 2021 – Oct 2022
### Environmental properties of the three studied bays in the research
• Optimization and practice of MPs extraction from sediments: greatly reduced the detection limits of MPs’ size  
• Measurement of physical and chemical properties of seawater and sediment and assessment of bays pollution
### Basic characteristics of microbial communities in the studied bays
• Diversity and species composition of the microbial communities: _α_ diversity, _β_ diversity  
• Analysis of the mechanism of microbial community construction using neutral community model
### Effects of MPs and other environmental factors on the microbial communities in the studied bays
• MPs, as an emerging pollutant and with huge pollution, had no significant effects on microbial communities

## <font color=blue>Discovery and study of the function of Ankyrin G (Ank G) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) model mice  </font> 
Advisor: Yan Zhang (Professor, Peking University)	  
Time: Jun 2023 – now
### Discovery and verification of down-regulation of Ank G expression in AD model mice
• Observation of fluorescent staining and analysis of spatial transcriptome sequencing in mouse brain sections  
• Mouse brain proteins extraction and Western blot experiment  
• _ANK3_ gene (encoding Ank G) knockout and rescue
### Effects of down-regulated Ank G expression on AD model mice
• Hippocampus atrophy observed by fluorescent staining in mouse brain sections  
• Behavioral abnormalities observed by Morris water maze (MWM), Y maze, etc. 
### Further studies (ongoing and to be updated)
• Correlation between Ank G down-regulation and abnormal performance in AD model mice  
• Relationship (signal pathways) between Ank G and neuronal death
