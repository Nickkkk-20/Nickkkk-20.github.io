## Discovery and verification of down-regulation of Ank G expression in AD model mice
• Observation of fluorescent staining and analysis of spatial transcriptome sequencing in mouse brain sections  
• Mouse brain proteins extraction and Western blot experiment  
• _ANK3_ gene (encoding Ank G) knockout and rescue
## Effects of down-regulated Ank G expression on AD model mice
• Hippocampus atrophy observed by fluorescent staining in mouse brain sections  
• Behavioral abnormalities observed by Morris water maze (MWM), Y maze, etc. 
## Further studies (ongoing and to be updated)
• Correlation between Ank G down-regulation and abnormal performance in AD model mice  
• Relationship (signal pathways) between Ank G and neuronal death
