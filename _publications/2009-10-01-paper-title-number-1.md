## Environmental properties of the three studied bays in the research
• Optimization and practice of MPs extraction from sediments: greatly reduced the detection limits of MPs’ size  
• Measurement of physical and chemical properties of seawater and sediment and assessment of bays pollution
## Basic characteristics of microbial communities in the studied bays
• Diversity and species composition of the microbial communities: _α_ diversity, _β_ diversity  
• Analysis of the mechanism of microbial community construction using neutral community model
## Effects of MPs and other environmental factors on the microbial communities in the studied bays
• MPs, as an emerging pollutant and with huge pollution, had no significant effects on microbial communities
