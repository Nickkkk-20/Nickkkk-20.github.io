**I am looking for a Ph.D. position in Neurobiology and/or Molecular Biology, aiming at unraveling the mechanisms behind the biological processes especially in diseases.**

I am a senior undergraduate student from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) (PKU), having double majors in **Environmental Science** from  [Environmental Sciences and Engineering](http://cese.pku.edu.cn) (CESE) and **Biology** from [School of Life Sciences](https://www.pku.edu.cn) (SKY). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yan Zhang](https://bio.pku.edu.cn/homes/Index/news_cont_jl/17/95.html) from SKY, Peking University, studying the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer Disease. Also, I was advised by [Prof. Donghui Wen](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/dhwen) from CESE, Peking University, studying microbial ecology in the coastal areas based on sequencing techniques.

You can find my CV here: [Yushu Wang's Curriculum Vitae](/assets/CV-YushuWANG,PKU.pdf). You can mail to me as well: [Email](mailto:2000013531@stu.pku.edu.cn).



# My Educational Background
B.S. (Environmental Science), PKU, Sep 2020 – Jun 2024  
B.S. (Biology), PKU, Jun 2021 – Jun 2024  
Member of _Beyond Boundary Program_ (BBP) in PKU, Sep 2021 – Jun 2024  
Participant Representing PKU in _Climate Connect_ (International Conference), Oct 2021 – Feb 2022



# My Research Experiences
## Study on the characteristics of microplastics (MPs) pollution in offshore sediments and its effects on microbial communities
Advisor: Donghui Wen (Professor, Peking University)  
Time: Jun 2021 – Oct 2022
### Environmental properties of the three studied bays in the research
• Optimization and practice of MPs extraction from sediments: greatly reduced the detection limits of MPs’ size  
• Measurement of physical and chemical properties of seawater and sediment and assessment of bays pollution
### Basic characteristics of microbial communities in the studied bays
• Diversity and species composition of the microbial communities: _α_ diversity, _β_ diversity  
• Analysis of the mechanism of microbial community construction using neutral community model
### Effects of MPs and other environmental factors on the microbial communities in the studied bays
• MPs, as an emerging pollutant and with huge pollution, had no significant effects on microbial communities  

## Discovery and study of the function of Ankyrin G (Ank G) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) model mice
Advisor: Yan Zhang (Professor, Peking University)	  
Time: Jun 2023 – now
### Discovery and verification of down-regulation of Ank G expression in AD model mice
• Observation of fluorescent staining and analysis of spatial transcriptome sequencing in mouse brain sections  
• Mouse brain proteins extraction and Western blot experiment  
• _ANK3_ gene (encoding Ank G) knockout and rescue
### Effects of down-regulated Ank G expression on AD model mice
• Hippocampus atrophy observed by fluorescent staining in mouse brain sections  
• Behavioral abnormalities observed by Morris water maze (MWM), Y maze, etc. 
### Further studies (ongoing and to be updated)
• Correlation between Ank G down-regulation and abnormal performance in AD model mice  
• Relationship (signal pathways) between Ank G and neuronal death



# My Teaching Experiences
## Genetics Lab.
<font color=grey> _teaching assistant_	   Sep 2023 – Jan 2024</font>  
• In class: tutored the students to carry out experiments such as the separation of salivary gland chromosomes of. _D. melanogaster_, basic methods for fruit fly phenotype identification, etc.  
• After class: conducted the culture and phenotype monitoring of experimental animals (_D. melanogaster_) required for class; prepared fruit fly culture medium and necessary experimental materials for class, etc.
## Cell Biology Lab.
<font color=grey> _teaching assistant_	   Sep 2023 – Jan 2024</font>
• In class: tutored the students about the basic norms in the cell biology laboratory and the experimental operation methods such as continuous cell culture, immunohistochemical staining, etc.  
• After class: helped the instructors to prepared the necessary experimental materials for class and checked for cell culture and contamination conditions, etc.
