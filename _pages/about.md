**I am looking for a Ph.D. position in Neurobiology and/or Molecular Biology, aiming at unraveling the mechanisms behind the biological processes especially in diseases.**

I am a senior undergraduate student from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) (PKU), having double majors in **Environmental Science** from  [Environmental Sciences and Engineering](http://cese.pku.edu.cn) (CESE) and **Biology** from [School of Life Sciences](https://www.pku.edu.cn) (SKY). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yan Zhang](https://bio.pku.edu.cn/homes/Index/news_cont_jl/17/95.html) from SKY, Peking University, studying the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer Disease. Also, I was advised by [Prof. Donghui Wen](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/dhwen) from CESE, Peking University, studying microbial ecology in the coastal areas based on sequencing techniques.
