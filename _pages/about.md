**I am looking for a Ph.D. position in Neuroscience and/or Molecular Biology.**

I am a senior undergraduate student from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), having double majors in **Environmental Science** from  [Environmental Sciences and Engineering](http://cese.pku.edu.cn), CESE and **Life Science** from [School of Life Sciences](https://www.pku.edu.cn), SKY. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. ZHANG Yan](https://bio.pku.edu.cn/homes/Index/news_cont_jl/17/95.html) from SKY, Peking University, studying the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer Disease. Also, I was advised by [Prof. WEN Donghui](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/dhwen) from CESE, Peking University, studying micro-ecology in the coastal areas based on sequencing techniques.
